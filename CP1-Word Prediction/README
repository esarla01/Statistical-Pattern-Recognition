Statistical Pattern Recognition (CP1: Probabilistic Prediction of Words)

Course: Tufts CS COMP 136 SPR | Spring 2023  
Assignment: CP1: Probabilistic Prediction of Words  

## Overview  
This project explores probabilistic modeling and hyperparameter selection using text data from U.S. presidential State of the Union addresses (1945-2016). The goal is to analyze, predict, and evaluate next-word probabilities using different statistical estimators and selection techniques.  

## Key Goals  
1. Implement and evaluate probabilistic models for next-word prediction.  
2. Explore methods to estimate hyperparameters for improved model performance.  

## Key Concepts  
- Categorical Distribution: Models vocabulary as discrete random variables.  
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (ML): Estimates word probabilities based on observed counts.  
- MAP & Posterior Predictive Estimation: Incorporates prior beliefs for robust probability estimates.  
- Hyperparameter Optimization: Uses marginal likelihood to select the best Dirichlet prior (α).  

## Project Deliverables  
1. Code Implementation:  
   - ML, MAP, and Posterior Predictive estimators (`fit` and `predict_proba` methods).  
   - Hyperparameter selection (`calc_per_word_log_evidence` method).  
2. Experiments:  
   - Compare test-set log likelihood across estimators with varying training set sizes.  
   - Assess α selection using log evidence and test-set likelihood.  
3. Report (PDF):  
   - Graphical and written analysis of estimator performance and hyperparameter optimization.  

## Dataset  
Text from State of the Union speeches (1945-2016). Training data includes 1945-2015; the 2016 speech serves as the test set.  

## Environment  
- Python environment: spr_2024s_env  
- Starter code: [Tufts CS136 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tufts-ml-courses/cs136-24s-assignments)  

## Instructions  
1. Train models using training data and test on 2016 speech.  
2. Submit:  
   - Code ZIP file with all `.py` files and edits.  
   - Report (PDF) with results, figures, and short answers.
