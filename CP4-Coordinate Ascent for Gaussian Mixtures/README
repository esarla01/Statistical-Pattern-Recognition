# HW4: K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models

## Overview
This homework covers K-Means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), focusing on the iterative process of K-Means and the relationship between GMMs and K-Means.

## Key Goals
- Implement the K-Means algorithm for clustering.
- Understand the relationship between GMM and K-Means.
- Derive the covariance for a mixture distribution.

## Key Concepts
- K-Means: An algorithm for partitioning data into clusters by minimizing a cost function.
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM): A probabilistic model representing a mixture of Gaussian distributions for clustering.
- Covariance of Mixtures: Describes the spread of data in a mixture distribution.

## Deliverables
1. Problem 1: K-Means walkthrough (steps for assignments and cluster updates).
2. Problem 2: Relationship between GMM and K-Means.
3. Problem 3: Derive the covariance for a mixture distribution.
